## Versions

### 0.0.1
**Initial**

- Added some default stuff (not everything) like a welcome screen.
 - should add an option (localstorage variable) that disables the welcome screen.
- Welcome screen is still W.I.P. and will eventually have audio.
 - With audio on page-visit it might be handy to have an audio slider on first visit.
- contains a lot of animation work in CSS3, this is still W.I.P. as well.
